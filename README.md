# ChassistantGPT

A **Chrome** browser extension that embeds ChatGPT as a hands-free voice assistant in the background. Any ChatGPT prompt is a quick "Hey girl" away!

ChassistantGPT **supports over 60 languages and dialects**. Pick your native language, and a **custom trigger phrase** (configurable in the tab). For example: who needs "Hey girl" when you can rock "Coucou Skynet" and converse with ChatGPT in French?

Instead of the voice trigger, you can also press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E from anywhere in the browser. Pressing it while ChassitantGPT is already listening for an instruction will stop it.

Please read the contents of the tab that will open when you install the extension. It contains important information about how to use the extension.
To keep the extension free to use, the speech capabilities are only supported in Chrome (excluding other Chromium-based browsers). However, the code is functional on all modern browsers.
